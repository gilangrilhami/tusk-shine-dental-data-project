## **Project Description**  
Tusk Shine Dental is more than just a dental clinic—it's the culmination of decades of experience, adaptability, and passion. Founded by a dedicated dentist with a remarkable journey from Indonesia to Texas, this fictional clinic embodies the pursuit of excellence and compassion in dental care.  

This repository is the starting point for crafting a data-driven strategy to ensure the clinic’s success. Leveraging the **CMS Open Payments dataset**, this project analyzes healthcare industry trends, competitor insights, and market opportunities to guide informed decision-making. The findings will play a key role in shaping Tusk Shine Dental’s service offerings, pricing models, and community engagement initiatives.
